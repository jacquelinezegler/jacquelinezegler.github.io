                My mom used to tell me before I was old enough to comprehend what she was saying that I should be the next Diane Sawyer when I grew up. I brushed her off then because I was four years old and I thought dolphins were cooler than the news. Her aspirations for me must have latched on to my subconscious because nearly fifteen years later, I found myself at the <span class="emphasis"><a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland</a></span>.

               I have always cared about storytelling. When I was a little girl, my younger sister and I would take videos of our dolls acting out ridiculous scenarios, boot up our very old desktop computer, and edit them together into a television show. Other times we would pop in our favorite Hilary Duff CD and record clips of our favorite songs. In between songs, we would talk about them and act as though we were hosts of a nationally syndicated radio show.

                I graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from UMD in December 2020 after completing classes coursework such as News Videography, Television Reporting & Production, News Writing and Reporting for Print and Broadcast, Interactive Design & Development, Photojournalism, Media Law and Ethics and Statistics for Journalists. My academic concentration outside of the College of Journalism is in <span class="emphasis">Film Studies</span>. I have recieved my <span class="emphasis"><a href="https://honors.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Honors Citation</a></span> for successfully completing all requirements within the Honors College as a member of the Honors Humanities program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the classroom, I have interned with the <span class="emphasis"><a href="https://childrensnational.org/visit/resources-for-families/creative-services/seacrest-studios" target="_blank">Ryan Seacrest Foundation at Childen's National Hospital</a></span> and with <span class="emphasis"><a href="https://www.siriusxm.com/potus" target="_blank">SiriusXM's POTUS Channel</a></span>. I also worked in a number of positions within the Honors College. I was a former office assitant and a social media intern for Honors Humanities. I also served as an <span class="emphasis">Honors Ambassador</span> and loved sharing my experiences at UMD with prospective students and families. Since high school, I worked seasonally as a legal assistant for the <span class="emphasis">Law Offices of Sciarra and Catrambone</span> in Clifton, New Jersey.
