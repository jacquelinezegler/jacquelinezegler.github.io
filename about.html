          <h2>hi! glad you're here.</h2>
          <p>
            My mom used to tell me before I was old enough to comprehend what she was saying that I should be the next Diane Sawyer when I grew up. I brushed her off then because I was four years old and I thought dolphins were cooler than the news. Her aspirations for me must have latched on to my subconscious because nearly fifteen years later, I found myself at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland.  It was only then that I realized production was what I truly wanted to be doing. The first time I found myself editing sound and audio, I was immediately reminded of memories from my youth.

            When I was a little girl, my younger sister and I would take videos of our dolls acting out ridiculous scenarios, boot up our very old desktop computer, and edit them together into a television show. Other times we would pop in our favorite Hilary Duff CD and record clips of our favorite songs. In between songs, we would talk about them and act as though we were hosts of a nationally syndicated radio show.

            It wasn't until recently that I realized that working in television and radio has been a lifelong dream of mine. I came to UMD with the full intention of becoming a writer after graduation. But halfway through my sophomore I switched my major to Broadcast Journalism and I am thrilled to be gaining the skills necessary to turn my passions into my career.

            Since stating at UMD, I have taken a number of journalism classes, such as News Videography, Television Reporting & Production, News Writing and Reporting for Print and Broadcast, Interactive Design & Development, Photojournalism, Media Law and Ethics and Statistics for Journalists. My academic concentration outside of the College of Journalism is in Film Studies. I have recently recieved my Honors Citation for successfully completing all requirements within the Honors College as a member of the Honors Humanities program.

            Outside of the classroom, I have interned with the Ryan Seacrest Foundation at Childen's National Hospital and with SiriusXM's POTUS Channel. I also worked in a number of positions within the Honors College. I was a former office assitant and a social media intern for Honors Humanities. Currently, I am an Honors Ambassador and love sharing my experiences at UMD with prospective students and families. Since high school, I have also worked seasonally as a legal assistant for the Law Offices of Sciarra and Catrambone in Clifton, New Jersey.
